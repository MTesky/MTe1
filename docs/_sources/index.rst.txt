UXsim: Traffic Simulation in Python
===================================

About
-----

UXsim is an open-source macroscopic and mesoscopic network traffic flow simulator developed in Python. 
This webpage is a technical documentation of UXsim codes.
Please visit `Github repo <https://github.com/toruseo/UXsim>`_ first. 

Example
-------
Belows are simulation result where approximately 60000 vehicles pass through a 10km x 10km grid network in 2 hours. The computation time was about 30 seconds on a standard desktop PC. 
The first animation shows link congestion level and the second shows sampled vehicle trajectories.
